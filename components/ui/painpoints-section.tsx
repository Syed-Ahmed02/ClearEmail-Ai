                    You open your inbox each morning only for "AI Email" to "always find a way to take over my day."
                    Before you know it, you're "buried in threads, prioritizing messages, and pulling out action items
                    manually," feeling like you "waste my time, scrubbing through the inbox" instead of doing actual
                    work.

                    about something that was buried in their inbox," or you're "prone to mistakes or unanswered emails"
                    that could cost you clients or opportunities.

                    "Inbox Zero" mindset (good in theory, hard to maintain)." But these manual approaches are never
                    truly effective, leaving you asking, "Is there a better way of doing this?" You don't "wanna waste
                    my time" anymore.

              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                You might believe a truly organized "AI Email" inbox requires constant manual effort or complex,
                expensive software. Or that you simply have to accept your "messy unorganized mailbox" as an inevitable
                part of modern digital life. <strong className="text-slate-800">That's a myth.</strong> The problem
                isn't you; it's that traditional email tools aren't built to handle today's overwhelming "AI Email"
                volume intelligently.
